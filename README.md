## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types
I have used the integer, character, and string variables to save user input such as the number of colors they will need or if they want to continue with the correct amount of colors.

### Console Input and Output
I used user input to get the number of colors they will need then I displayed it in the file that they named.

### Decisions
I used an if statment to determine if the user wants to continue with the correct amount of colors.

### Iteration

I used a loop for if the user doesn't want to continue with the number of colors they typed in they can go back and type a different amount.

### File Input and Output
I allowed the user to create their own file then displayed their inputs in the file.
